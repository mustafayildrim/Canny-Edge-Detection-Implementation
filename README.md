# Canny-Edge-Detection-Implementation
This project implements the Canny edge detection algorithm, up to but not including the hysteresis step. The function, MyCanny, processes a grayscale image using edge detection parameters and returns a binary edge map. The implementation includes Gaussian smoothing and gradient magnitude thresholding to detect edges accurately without thickening.
